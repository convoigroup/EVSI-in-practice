A companion repository for the code required to perform the calculations in the paper ``Calculating the Expected Value of Sample Information in Practice: Considerations from Three Case Studies.`` This paper compares four recent EVSI calculation methods on three case studies that have been developed to reflect real-world characteristics of EVSI estimation.
